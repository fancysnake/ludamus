# Refactor

This code is AI-generated mess. I'm going to gradually make it better,
to achieve satisfying level of code quality.

## Layers

- binds - entrypoints
- gates - inbound adapters (to be used in binds only)
- gears - domain logic (to be used in binds only)
- links - outbound adapters (to be used in binds only)
- pacts - ports/protocols
- specs - settings (to be used in binds only)
